# How to run
`$> yarn`
install dependencies

`$> npm start -s`
And open your browser and locate to http://localhost:3000
The detail configuration can be found in webpack.config.js

## Run eslint
`$> npm run lint -s`
Use `-s` to slient the npm error message when eslint is failed. (Eslint will print failed reason, so we don't need npm to print again.)
